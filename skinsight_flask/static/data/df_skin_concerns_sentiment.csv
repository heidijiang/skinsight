Rich in moisturizing polysaccharides, mineral salts, and potassium, Grape Water has an intense ability to retain water. Perfect for sensitive skin and the perfect go-to after any harsh peels or uncomfortable irritation, it acts as a calming treatment-soothing rosacea, reducing redness and sensitivity, and calming rashes. The unique composition with mineral and active plant ingredients strengthens the skin's barrier function, making it more resilient and less sensitive over time. The versatile product can be used as a toner after cleansing, as a setting spray before applying makeup, or to refresh and hydrate the skin throughout the day. What else you need to know: Makeup pro tip: dampen makeup sponge to give dewy glow to foundation. Dampen eyeshadow brush to intensify shadow pigment. Caudalie founder Mathilde Thomas discovered this precious water on her parent’s vineyard in Bordeaux when her family during the harvest to extract water from the grapes. ""This is literally pure grape water, so you can think of this as like a fire hydrant for your face. If you have irritation, if you have dryness, if you have anything that is going on that you just want to soothe it, calm it, hydrate it, bring it back to normal-that’s what this does and it’s incredible. Plus, you can set your makeup in the end with it, too!""-David Razzano, Sephora Pro Artist ""Our entire Sephora Pro Team is obsessed with this because we realize that it takes away redness in the skin, so it’s perfect for a person like myself who gets super flushed every time I do any activity at all. This is like a quick fix because it just takes the redness down pretty immediately. We use it backstage a lot in fashion week because it basically takes down that redness.""-Helen Phillips, Sephora Pro Artist Research results: In a corneometry, 12 volunteers: - +127% immediate hydration In a clinical test, 20 volunteers: - -62% in skin sensitivity Clean at Sephora When you spot our Clean seal, you can be sure we’ve checked that this brand’s product is made without the ingredients you told us you’d most like to avoid.

Menthol and vitamin C help wake-up and invigorate skin while small, highly uniform scrubbing particles open congested pores and sweep away deep-down oil, dirt and dead skin cells. Why bother? Because removing oil, dirt and dead cells helps the razor get closer to the skin for a smoother, easier shave. Getting rid of those dead cells also helps prevent in-grown hairs.What else you need to know:Regular exfoliation (gently scrubbing off old skin cells) also improves skin's appearance and radiance by exposing newer, younger cells beneath the surface.

What it is formulated to do:One of Shiseido’s most iconic products launched in Japan over 100 years ago, this illuminating and hydrating essence is an essential step in any J-beauty routine.

What it does:Use this convenient tool to relieve your complexion by effectively extracting black and white heads. This hygienic tool will not leave marks or scars if used properly. The lance delicately pierces white heads when necessary and all parts of the tool can be used on both face and body. The tool is designed with a pretty slate finish and the handle fits comfortably in the hand for ease and accuracy.

Solutions for:- Fine lines and wrinkles- Loss of firmness and elasticity- DrynessIf you want to know more…This multifunctional anti-aging serum offers a daily-dose of anti-aging defense. The silky liquid texture is readily absorbed allowing for immediate delivery of the efficacious ingredients. Serums are intended to be used with a moisturizer or blended with another product. It is the ideal companion to any of our moisturizers (Double-Duty Face Moisturizer SPF 20, Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer, Dry Erase Ultra-Calming Face Cream, or Line Smoother 8% Glycolic Acid Treatment) or Post Shave Cooling Gel. Except for customers with oily skin, serums are not intended to provide adequate hydration when used alone. Peptides are chains of amino acids (the building blocks of protein) that are essential to human life. They function as messengers in the skin, allowing the epidermis and dermis to communicate more efficiently. As we age, communication diminishes within the skin resulting in fine lines, wrinkles, and loss of elasticity. Peptides improve cell communication by sending specific signals that affect skin's response.What it is formulated WITHOUT:- Parabens- Sulfates- PhthalatesWhat else you need to know: This product is vegan, cruelty-free, and formulated without fragrance and colorant.",False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,True,4.5555555555555545,0.9629629629629628,0.9336995618478524,27,-0.040579597723637985,0.11246841796443116,0.07586964481254062,0.10953292919341892,0.0,0.1597352481761724,https://www.sephora.com/product/protein-booster-skin-serum-P236605,-0.06333333333333332,0.0,2.0,5.0,1.8028303616251755,0.0,0.0,-0.06333333333333332,0.0,2.0,5.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,3.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,8.0,,,,,,,2.0,,,0.14484126984126985,4.0,1.0,7.0,1.6775351650736292,0.3755282641185389,0.3004226112948311,0.15166666666666667,3.0,1.0,5.0,13.0,0.30063605244263664,0.2254770393319775,,,,,3.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,0.12777777777777774,1.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,,,,,2.0,,,-0.5625,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.240979989187638,0.0,0.0,-0.5625,0.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,3.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,8.0,,,,,,,2.0,,,0.18974747474747475,8.0,1.0,11.0,1.8995769689941744,0.5649937852319398,0.5022166979839464,0.15138888888888888,4.0,1.0,6.0,13.0,0.3755282641185389,0.3004226112948311,0.20833333333333331,1.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.2466666666666667,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.25555555555555554,1.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.26,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.13166666666666668,4.0,0.0,5.0,1.7303454881625968,0.5100999795960008,0.5100999795960008,0.08333333333333333,2.0,0.0,3.0,13.0,0.3423719528896193,0.3423719528896193,,,,,3.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,0.06666666666666668,1.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.34166666666666673,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.22001262626262627,9.0,0.0,11.0,1.3103282682215494,0.7008472464490406,0.7008472464490406,0.16708333333333333,4.0,0.0,5.0,13.0,0.5100999795960008,0.5100999795960008,0.20833333333333331,1.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,,,,,1.0,,,0.2504629629629629,3.0,0.0,3.0,8.0,0.4384939195509822,0.4384939195509822,0.4166666666666667,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,27,89.0,7.0,41.0,11.0,2.0

Over time, the appearance of dark circles, fine lines, and crow's feet are reduced and the eye area is smoother.What it is formulated WITHOUT:- Sulfates- PhthalatesWhat else you need to know: This product is safe for sensitive eyes, and allergy tested under ophthalmological and dermatological control.",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,True,True,4.0613496932515325,0.9631901840490796,1.1795230859517396,163,0.008894155771493434,0.17629227616747434,0.06095416726960101,-0.03398742543162918,0.0,-0.1095239642401698,https://www.sephora.com/product/genifique-eye-youth-activating-eye-concentrate-P247905,0.10936904761904763,3.0,2.0,5.0,1.8028303616251755,0.23071993220883705,0.1384319593253022,-0.08,0.0,1.0,1.0,61.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,20.0,,,0.1388392857142857,1.0,1.0,2.0,15.0,0.09452865480086613,0.047264327400433064,0.17458333333333334,2.0,0.0,2.0,47.0,0.3423719528896193,0.3423719528896193,,,,,20.0,,,0.009065262412484641,32.0,33.0,72.0,1.6775351650736292,0.3746363604246928,0.1844363620552334,0.02100645342312009,15.0,13.0,33.0,61.0,0.35812395142101666,0.1918521168326875,0.00962121212121213,4.0,5.0,11.0,20.0,0.18877542947191397,0.08390019087640622,0.03888888888888889,3.0,3.0,6.0,15.0,0.1876128068994087,0.09380640344970437,-0.015080567580567581,7.0,8.0,15.0,47.0,0.2480922525974644,0.1157763845454834,-0.02192460317460317,3.0,4.0,7.0,20.0,0.15821692226262685,0.06780725239826864,,,,,1.240979989187638,,,,,,,61.0,,,,,,,20.0,,,,,,,15.0,,,,,,,47.0,,,,,,,20.0,,,0.3059750159642401,54.0,0.0,58.0,1.8995769689941744,0.933584133218998,0.933584133218998,0.2934635416666666,22.0,0.0,24.0,61.0,0.8513404742740388,0.8513404742740388,0.26416666666666666,6.0,0.0,6.0,20.0,0.6096569663469354,0.6096569663469354,0.1987037037037037,5.0,0.0,6.0,15.0,0.565508505247919,0.565508505247919,0.3266732804232804,13.0,0.0,14.0,47.0,0.7718981569447084,0.7718981569447084,0.41909722222222223,8.0,0.0,8.0,20.0,0.6755843804891231,0.6755843804891231,0.09582782186948853,12.0,2.0,18.0,1.7303454881625968,0.600580922361363,0.5147836477383111,-0.0030277777777777733,3.0,1.0,5.0,61.0,0.30063605244263664,0.2254770393319775,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,20.0,,,0.029365079365079358,2.0,1.0,3.0,15.0,0.20765495512648788,0.1384366367509919,0.14677083333333335,6.0,0.0,8.0,47.0,0.6096569663469354,0.6096569663469354,0.4777777777777778,1.0,0.0,1.0,20.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.13572219171099764,51.0,12.0,67.0,1.3103282682215494,0.695929795848279,0.5633717394962259,0.16489718614718618,26.0,4.0,31.0,61.0,0.7031831605558306,0.6094254058150532,0.146875,6.0,0.0,8.0,20.0,0.6096569663469354,0.6096569663469354,0.1125,6.0,1.0,7.0,15.0,0.4868654966809702,0.417313282869403,0.07068518518518521,8.0,6.0,15.0,47.0,0.3259026690286936,0.18623009658782488,0.1597993827160494,5.0,1.0,6.0,20.0,0.4364905634363539,0.3637421361969616,163,314.0,97.0,229.0,97.0,85.0

What it is formulated to do:This powerful treatment tightens, firms, and smooths the appearance of the eye area to create younger-looking skin. It temporarily minimizes the appearance of crow’s feet, fine lines, deep wrinkles, and under-eye puffiness. What else you need to know:Simply apply, let dry, and pat away excess residue to erase the look of fine lines and wrinkles around the eye area. A little product is all that is required to get maximum results; applying too much will not increase results. A white residue may be left after product dries in three to seven minutes; this is normal. To remove the white residue, pat away excess with fingertips, a q-tip, or a damp cloth. Makeup can be applied over Instant FIRMx Eye, but results may be lessened-it is best when used alone for a quick, temporary pick me up. For optimal results, follow with any moisturizer appropriate for your skin type. Research results:In a consumer efficacy study immediately following application on 25 women, ranging in age from 35 to 65: - 92% agreed that their eye area appeared smoother - 92% agreed that their under-eye puffiness appeared diminished - 88% agreed that their eye area appeared tightened - 84% agreed that their eye area was instantly transformed",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,3.4437086092715226,0.9403973509933776,1.5732588750293828,151,-0.01838932434946831,0.26755059079358456,-0.14589051515362605,0.04042981942476265,-0.3703069669102922,-0.08992308805805242,https://www.sephora.com/product/instant-firmx-eye-P283106,0.010000000000000007,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.8028303616251755,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,46.0,,,,,,,15.0,,,,,,,14.0,,,0.020000000000000014,1.0,0.0,1.0,57.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,,,,,19.0,,,-0.003918650793650792,5.0,8.0,14.0,1.6775351650736292,0.17709446581236818,0.06811325608168008,0.09166666666666667,1.0,1.0,2.0,46.0,0.09452865480086613,0.047264327400433064,0.15,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.1,1.0,0.0,1.0,14.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,-0.054513888888888896,1.0,5.0,6.0,57.0,0.03005258587173028,0.0050087643119550475,-0.040277777777777767,1.0,2.0,4.0,19.0,0.06149031527616052,0.02049677175872017,-0.10347222222222223,0.0,3.0,5.0,1.240979989187638,0.0,0.0,,,,,46.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,15.0,,,-0.07777777777777779,0.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,-0.14652777777777776,0.0,2.0,3.0,57.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,19.0,,,0.2653279320987655,13.0,3.0,18.0,1.8995769689941744,0.5699064013154177,0.4630489510687769,0.215,3.0,3.0,7.0,46.0,0.1876128068994087,0.09380640344970437,0.15,1.0,0.0,1.0,15.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.125,1.0,0.0,2.0,14.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.3711805555555556,5.0,0.0,5.0,57.0,0.565508505247919,0.565508505247919,0.3383333333333334,3.0,0.0,3.0,19.0,0.4384939195509822,0.4384939195509822,-0.0722222222222222,1.0,2.0,6.0,1.7303454881625968,0.06149031527616052,0.02049677175872017,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,46.0,,,,,,,15.0,,,-0.23333333333333334,0.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,-0.049999999999999975,1.0,1.0,4.0,57.0,0.09452865480086613,0.047264327400433064,,,,,19.0,,,0.17339191232048382,31.0,2.0,42.0,1.3103282682215494,0.8039341828220182,0.7552108990146232,0.10357142857142856,5.0,0.0,8.0,46.0,0.565508505247919,0.565508505247919,0.225,2.0,0.0,2.0,15.0,0.3423719528896193,0.3423719528896193,0.10916666666666666,4.0,1.0,5.0,14.0,0.3755282641185389,0.3004226112948311,0.2171980676328502,18.0,0.0,23.0,57.0,0.8241154494176252,0.8241154494176252,0.115625,2.0,1.0,4.0,19.0,0.20765495512648788,0.1384366367509919,151,204.0,108.0,287.0,89.0,74.0

What it is formulated to do:Refining Facial Polisher restores dull, tired skin to its former radiance through a combination of mechanical and chemical exfoliation. Skin becomes smoother and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles are reduced due to the high concentration of lava powder and tropical fruit extracts. It improves the look of UV damage and further protects from sun damage, resulting in clearer, softer, healthier-looking skin. What else you need to know:Harnessing the transformative power of Hungarian moor mud and green microalgae to reveal a radiant, smooth, and more refined complexion, the Refining Polisher is also fast-acting for immediate results. This potent product has a striking brilliant green hue, laced with copper and exotic fruit extracts; it swiftly turns into a glistening sheer veil on application. Working with a Hungarian Nobel Prize-winning laboratory, Omorovicza Cosmetics developed and patented the Healing Concentrate™ to deliver all the potent minerals occurring naturally in the Omorovicza healing waters deep into the epidermis.

T.L.C. Framboos™ enhances the performance of other products by clearing the way for maximum absorption.Solutions for:- Uneven skin tone- Dullness and uneven texture- PoresIf you want to know more…This high-tech gel resurfaces dull skin, lifting dead skin cells away by gently dissolving the glue that holds them to the surface. The results are greater clarity and a smoother, more even-looking complexion. Formulated with a dream-team AHA/BHA blend including glycolic, lactic, tartaric, citric, and salicylic acids, and blended with raspberry extract, T.L.C. Framboos™ sinks in easily and delivers an effective level of chemical exfoliation without the harsh side effects like dryness or sensitization. Fine lines, wrinkles, and discoloration, along with excess oiliness and the appearance of pores, appear dramatically diminished over time. Horse chestnut, bearberry, and white tea help to calm and soothe, while improving the appearance of broken capillaries. Go from a drab complexion to an absolutely luminous one-practically overnight. What else you need to know: AHA’s can be harsh on sensitive skin if not formulated properly. Soothing plant extracts were added to T.L.C.

Solutions for: - Dryness - Redness If you want to know more… This luxurious cleanser made with Greek yogurt is rich in proteins, minerals, and vitamins to gently cleanse while nourishing-leaving skin soft and supple, and reducing redness. The formula also easily removes makeup and impurities without irritation. The cleanser includes amaranth seed extract to soothe, as well as calming honeysuckle to provide antibacterial benefits. What else you need to know: An ingredient used for centuries in Greece for its smoothing and strengthening properties, Greek yogurt contains two and a half times the protein of regular yogurt. By boosting your skin care routine with protein-rich Greek yogurt, you deliver the same benefits to your skin that protein delivers to your body-helping to nourish, strengthen, and repair. In Greece, this cherished ingredient is used by families and villages for their own unique recipes and beauty remedies that have been passed down from generation to generation. In 2003, KORRES became the world's first brand to incorporate edible Greek yogurt into a skincare formula. This product contains 86.4 percent natural ingredients, and like all KORRES formulations, it is made without petrolatum, mineral oil, silicones, propylene glycol, and ethanolamines.

What it is formulated WITHOUT:- Parabens - Phthalates What else you need to know:Olivier Baussan, founder of L'OCCITANE, discovered the benefits of shea butter during a trip to Burkina Faso in the 80’s. He was amazed to learn that women from Burkina Faso traditionally massage shea butter on newborns to protect them against harsh environmental elements (the sun, wind, etc.) and to soothe irritations.

What it is formulated to do:Divine Eyes is a powerful youth-preserving eye cream to fight visible signs of aging.

Buckwheat wax helps visibly reduce puffiness around the eyes, while the formula’s fresh, silky texture melts into the skin to reveal a visibly younger-looking eye area. What it is formulated WITHOUT:- Parabens- Sulfates - Phthalates What else you need to know:On the island of Corsica grows an extraordinary flower, immortelle, which owes its name to its exceptional longevity as it never fades even after being picked. To preserve the fields of wild immortelle flowers in Corsica, L’Occitane partnered with expert local farmers to launch the first organic cultivation of immortelle, ensuring its sustainable future.

Solutions for: - Dryness - Dullness and uneven texture - Loss of firmness and elasticity If you want to know more…This biocellulose treatment mask contains an anti-aging serum: a proprietary complex of Okinawa red algae and natural hyaluronic acid that delivers an instantly hydrated, firmed, and lifted appearance. Each mask is distilled from an entire coconut into an ultra-concentrated mask, forming an occlusive layer on the skin and allowing for 53 percent more efficient penetration of its serum than paper masks. The pure and powerful active ingredients are able to quickly saturate the skin, infusing revitalizing moisture and plumping away the appearance of fine lines. Tatcha's signature Hadasei-3-a trio of anti-aging Japanese superfoods born from nourishing green tea, rice, and algae-restores a healthy-looking, youthful radiance. What else you need to know: The remarkable efficacy of the geisha’s mask treatments can be traced back centuries to an ancient beauty text. Etched onto its pages is the depiction of tea kettles with swatches of kimono silk set atop lids to capture the essence of botanicals distilled by steam overnight. Rich in vital fresh extracts, the saturated cloth would then be applied to the geisha’s face. The Luminous Deep Hydration Lifting Mask brings this timeless practice to life with an advanced sheet mask. This pure formula is non-irritating, non-sensitizing, dermatologist tested, cruelty-free, and formulated without synthetic fragrances, mineral oil, sulfate detergents, urea, DEA, or TEA.

Each adhesive patch is a fully contained treatment to penetrate pores and clear up acne. Because treatment is contained to the affected area only, the product will not rub off or cause unnecessary irritation or dryness to surrounding skin.

This formula helps to replenish lipids and visibly reduce the appearance of dark spots and wrinkles after applying regularly. Uniquely formulated with pumpkin ferment extract and pomegranate enzyme, C-Firma™ enzymatically dissolves dead surface skin cells. Sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer quickly sinks into skin and provides ultimate hydration. The result is a noticeably diminished appearance of photo damage, replaced by incredible radiance and luminosity. What else you need to know: C-Firma™ has a reservoir effect, which means it will stay active on skin for up to 72 hours and cannot be washed or rubbed off. Its pH level is 3.3, which Drunk Elephant believes is the key to a non-irritating, effective formulation that delivers real results. This product is 100 percent free of essential oils and fragrance.Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what Drunk Elephant calls the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels.

Solutions for: - Fine lines and wrinkles- Loss of firmness and elasticity- Dryness If you want to know more… This oil-free, innovative resculpting serum is formulated with Caudalie's new breakthrough patent of stabilized vine resveratrol (for firmness) and micro hyaluronic acids (for volume) to visibly recontour, refirm, and replump aging skin. For the first time, these molecules' synergy is being harnessed to support skin's natural production of hyaluronic acid, so the skin is plumped from within. The formula is further enriched with a peptide composition that works on natural collagen and elastin to lift the look of facial contours and reduce visible effects of aging. The light, hydrating texture blends into the skin without any sticky residue and can be applied under makeup. What else you need to know:Resveratrol Lift Firming Serum is winner of a Women’s Health 2017 Beauty Award. Research has unveiled a surprising synergy between a molecule from grapevine called resveratrol, and a complex of micro hyaluronic acids. While each ingredient is effective on its own, the combination is a breakthrough because it helps support the skin's own production of natural hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid is naturally present in the skin and plays an important role in hydration and preservation. A decrease in hyaluronic acid quantity and quality with age leads to dryness and the appearance of wrinkles. Caudalie's new patented complex helps support the skin to make its own natural hylauronic acid. This product is noncomedogenic and tested under dermatological supervision.

Solutions for: - Fine lines and wrinkles- Loss of firmness and elasticity- Dryness If you want to know more…Resveratrol Lift Night Cream is the winner of the Good Housekeeping “Miracle Anti-Agers” Award for Best Hero-Hydrating Night Cream. Wake up to smoother, brighter, firmer-looking skin with this cutting-edge formula that features Caudalie's breakthrough clinical patent vine resveratrol to visibly rebuild, repair, and resculpt skin. Resveratrol-the renowned antiaging ingredient pioneered by Caudalie in 1997-diminishes visible wrinkles and enhances skin firmness, with the same regenerating process that allows grape vines to live up to 100 years. Grape seed oil and organic shea butter nourish and restore skin while ceramides support the skin barrier throughout the night. Its plant cocktail of chamomile flowers, poppy, lavender water, sage, fresh mint, and orange leaves soothes and calms for visibly refreshed skin by morning. What else you need to know: Caudalie's patented and stabilized vine resveratrol was discovered in Bordeaux, France at Caudalie's family vineyard, Chateau Smith Haut Lafitte. Sourced from grapevine stalks, it is an antiaging revolution that naturally intensifies the firmness and youthfulness of the skin. No other molecule has fueled as much hope for health, notably in the field of cell degeneration. Grapevines have an incredible power to resist the harsh effects of the cold, wind, and rain to live for up to 100 years. Their secret? Resveratrol, a substance that the vine produces to protect itself.

Solutions for:- Fine lines and wrinkles- Loss of firmness and elasticity- Dryness If you want to know more…This highly effective firming and de-puffing eye balm is powered by resveratrol-a natural ingredient derived from the grapevine to lift and iron out wrinkles, support elastin and collagen, and enhance your skin’s natural ability to produce hyaluronic acid. Micro hyaluronic acids melt deeply into the fragile eye area to plump, hydrate, and reverse fine lines, while advanced peptides redefine and lift eye contour to leave you with a youthful dewiness. To combat puffiness and dark circles, this eye balm uses a natural plant complex from silk trees to drain and smooth out under eye area. The texture is silky and absorbs into skin without the use of synthetic emulsifiers-and lays smoothly under makeup. What else you need to know:This product is ophthalmologist tested, so you can use it around your entire eye (eyelids included). It is vegan, non-toxic, cruelty-free, safe for pregnancy and sensitive skin, hypoallergenic, and free of all synthetic chemicals, artificial fragrances, fillers, gluten, and GMOs. Fun fact: resveratrol is a rare species that can live up to 120 years, so it knows all about anti-aging. ""Be gone, tired eyes. This magic balm is your one-way ticket to brighter looking eyes in an instant. What’s its secret weapon? We’re glad you asked. The clever formula uses two key ingredients: stabilized vine resveratrol and micro hyaluronic acid, which work together to boost production of natural hyaluronic acid to replump the skin. Packed full of anti-peptides and anti-aging ingredients, this cream promises to banish dark circles, reduce puffiness, and smooth out even the finest of wrinkles, leaving your eyes looking smooth and rested. The cream is light, non-greasy, and fragrance-free, making this a great choice for those with sensitive skin. The super-soft balm can even be used to reduce fine lines around the lip area too, meaning this really is the ultimate beauty buy and well worth the investment.""-Marie Claire UK Research results:In a satisfaction test on 100 people, after 28 days: - 80% of testers reported a reduction in under-eye puffiness Clean at Sephora When you spot our Clean seal, you can be sure we’ve checked that this brand’s product is made without the ingredients you told us you’d most like to avoid.

Murad formulates with the highest level available without a prescription. In as little as one week, it fades the look of dark spots, sun spots, age spots, and uneven skin tone. Rapid Age Spot and Pigment Lightening Serum combines hydroquinone with hexapeptide-2, a powerful skin-brightening peptide that helps lighten dark spots and prevent the appearance of future damage for a more even, more radiant skin tone. Exfoliating glycolic acid lifts away dull, dead skin cells and allows active ingredients to penetrate more quickly, so you see spots fade faster and more radiant skin sooner.What it is formulated WITHOUT:- Parabens- Sulfates- PhthalatesWhat else you need to know: Hydroquinone is the only over-the-counter skin lightener approved by the FDA. For more than 50 years, dermatologists like Dr. Murad have prescribed hydroquinone because of its excellent ability to lighten frustrating dark spots, sun spots, and age spots on all skin tones.

They learned of its incredible benefits from Ama, Japanese female free divers who spend four hours a day, every day harvesting treasures from the sea wearing only a loin cloth. To protect their skin and hair from the salty, cold ocean water, they coat their skin with camellia oil. This beauty secret has been advanced for the lips by the Tatcha Institute in Japan with the Gold Camellia Beauty Oil.This product is non-irritating, non-sensitizing, dermatologist tested, and cruelty-free.

Hadasei-3™, Tatcha’s trinity of anti-aging Japanese superfoods green tea, rice, and algae restores a healthy-looking, youthful radiance. The unique formula is firm and bouncy to the touch, dissolving luxuriously into the skin for a smooth, sensuous application. What else you need to know:Off the southernmost tip of Japan’s mainland lies Okinawa, a collection of tropical islands famed for its white sand beaches, pristine waters, and inhabitants who have one of the world’s longest average lifespans. The precious red algae harvested there is called “treasure from the god of the sea,” and has long been prized for its moisture-retaining qualities. The Night Concentrate harnesses its gift of replenishing hydration for dewy skin by morning. Luminous Dewy Skin Night Concentrate was previously known as the Luminous Overnight Memory Serum Concentrate. Tatcha has updated the name and packaging to better reflect that it is the perfect night companion to their Luminous Dewy Skin Mist. It is exactly the same beloved formula as before. This formula is noncomedogenic, non-irritating, non-sensitizing, dermatologist tested, cruelty-free, and formulated without mineral oil, synthetic fragrances, sulfate detergents, urea, DEA, or TEA.

They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility.

They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels.

Solutions for: - Dark spots - Dryness - Fine lines and wrinkles If you want to know more… Tidal Brightening Enzyme Water Cream delivers an intense water drench with two forms of hyaluronic acid and tamarind extract so your skin looks youthfully hydrated and plumped. Papaya enzymes smooth and exfoliate while alpha-arbutin visibly brightens the appearance of hyperpigmentation and dark spots. Tidal increases hydration by up to 68 percent in as little as 15 minutes for up to 24 hours of continuous moisture. What it is formulated WITHOUT: - Parabens - Sulfates - Phthalates What else you need to know: Alpha-arbutin is more powerful than the more commonly used beta-arbutin (also called bearberry or uva ursi). ""I was inspired by the skin-plumping power of water creams, but I wanted to make something special. I formulated Tidal to be a brightening treatment, infused into a water cream for a cutting-edge answer to both alternative signs of aging, including hyperpigmentation. The quest for the ultimate, all-skin-types moisturizer was born. Papaya enzymes smooth the skin and gently exfoliate for immediate improvement in texture.""-Sunday Riley This product is cruelty-free.Research results:Tested via corneometer (in vivo): - 68% increase in skin moisture in 15 minutes - Retain moisture for over 24 hours",False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,4.057887120115773,0.9015918958031838,1.2693057072841092,691,-0.39748533201866376,0.659289195704309,0.01092055462119731,0.2909259155088401,0.2452204992591075,0.27649749624274433,https://www.sephora.com/product/tidal-brightening-enzyme-water-cream-P406938,0.06960443023075298,91.0,55.0,189.0,1.8028303616251755,0.5424754792444779,0.3381182781592294,0.054506269193769184,28.0,17.0,65.0,244.0,0.4762967000646754,0.2963623911513536,0.1163655462184874,8.0,7.0,17.0,62.0,0.3011663015105079,0.16062202747227086,0.12311691086691084,11.0,8.0,26.0,63.0,0.3627555146516011,0.21001635058776907,0.05185474589964028,37.0,21.0,71.0,247.0,0.5092728615828535,0.32488096342354444,0.0751388888888889,7.0,2.0,10.0,75.0,0.4525833436728054,0.35200926730107085,0.182031214552826,154.0,39.0,241.0,1.6775351650736292,0.7357163793629001,0.5870483027040757,0.1865350698684032,61.0,13.0,91.0,244.0,0.7222779521065887,0.5953912848446204,0.19002063492063487,15.0,6.0,25.0,62.0,0.5004322617716241,0.3574516155511601,0.07814153439153439,9.0,5.0,21.0,63.0,0.3876400468214041,0.2491971729566169,0.1926685312679288,53.0,12.0,83.0,247.0,0.7044577741729509,0.5744040312487138,0.2148502456538171,16.0,3.0,21.0,75.0,0.6243407235682331,0.5257606093206173,0.08259515220229507,23.0,9.0,42.0,1.240979989187638,0.5462516306188822,0.3926183595073216,0.0706138452191084,9.0,5.0,19.0,244.0,0.3876400468214041,0.2491971729566169,-0.08333333333333333,0.0,1.0,1.0,62.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,63.0,,,0.07953703703703703,11.0,3.0,18.0,247.0,0.5241027622679172,0.4117950274962207,0.25966666666666666,3.0,0.0,3.0,75.0,0.4384939195509822,0.4384939195509822,0.23419103486520995,163.0,18.0,197.0,1.8995769689941744,0.8482891595705269,0.7639289116574358,0.21795807682577165,60.0,9.0,77.0,244.0,0.7703148508859572,0.6698390007703975,0.2227040612895876,16.0,3.0,19.0,62.0,0.6243407235682331,0.5257606093206173,0.2528483245149913,15.0,1.0,18.0,63.0,0.7167073163197013,0.67191310904972,0.2221101583601584,55.0,4.0,65.0,247.0,0.8382425011833289,0.7814125011031031,0.3407252585377586,17.0,1.0,18.0,75.0,0.7424220019799247,0.7011763352032622,0.10995274563615677,86.0,17.0,107.0,1.7303454881625968,0.7514932393345533,0.6274603745900154,0.11830830830830832,29.0,7.0,37.0,244.0,0.6497163793648479,0.5233826389327942,0.207,9.0,1.0,10.0,62.0,0.5958436145024277,0.536259253052185,0.12250000000000005,3.0,0.0,4.0,63.0,0.4384939195509822,0.4384939195509822,0.09651003355271648,34.0,6.0,41.0,247.0,0.7092737396097997,0.6028826786683297,0.058041666666666665,11.0,3.0,15.0,75.0,0.5241027622679172,0.4117950274962207,0.16045687757808968,24.0,4.0,33.0,1.3103282682215494,0.6850982695512267,0.5872270881867657,0.2178243978243978,11.0,0.0,13.0,244.0,0.7411599827511859,0.7411599827511859,0.15618386243386242,4.0,1.0,6.0,62.0,0.3755282641185389,0.3004226112948311,,,,,63.0,,,0.11740435490435493,9.0,3.0,13.0,247.0,0.4676896608793401,0.3507672456595051,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,75.0,,,691,1316.0,432.0,1333.0,358.0,321.0

What it is formulated WITHOUT:- Parabens- Sulfates- Phthalates What else you need to know: “Tucked away on the top of a hill in central Italy is a small gem of a town called Nocera Umbra. I traveled to this picturesque village almost 18 years ago to discover their hidden secret-Umbrian clay, an ultra-fine mineral-rich clay. This unique clay has been around for centuries and was even used by the ancient Etruscans for its array of benefits. I have been impressed with its versatility and high level of effectiveness ever since my first visit. I am always excited to develop new products that deliver the clay, which I call a ‘miracle ingredient,’ in its purest form. Our newest innovation is a purifying toner which does just that. Ideal for all skin types, I use the toner to gently remove impurities while toning and balancing my skin. The refreshing formula also minimizes the appearance of my pores without drying out my skin, leaving my complexion soft and smooth.

Solutions for:- Acne and blemishes- Blackheads- Pores If you want to know more…With 1.5 percent salicylic acid, this fast-acting, quick-drying, medicated oil clears acne and blackhead-causing buildup and debris from congested pores for smoother, blemish-free skin. Tea tree oil and black cumin seed oil support clear skin, while hexylresorcinol and licorice naturally brighten the appearance of old acne discolorations for a more even-toned complexion. Counterbalancing the potentially drying effects of salicylic acid, milk thistle and cucumber seed oil nourish the skin and smooth the appearance of lines and wrinkles, without leaving a greasy residue. Chamomile and neroli soothe stressed, blemish-prone skin. What it is formulated WITHOUT:- Parabens- Sulfates- Phthalates What else you need to know:""When I formulated U.F.O., I wanted to create a dry oil that practically disappears into the skin, leaving oily skin smooth (but never greasy) and yet effectively treated for blemishes and blackheads. Salicylic acid is notoriously over-drying, leaving your skin stripped and looking irritated. By infusing salicylic acid into clarifying oils (like tea tree oil and black cumin seed oil), the drying effects of salicylic acid are nipped in the bud, while all of the treatment aspects (like clearing congested pores and managing blackheads and blemishes) are in full-force. U.F.O. is part of the new Green Line, along with Martian Mattiyfing Melting Water-Gel Toner, created specifically for oily skin clients.""-Sunday Riley",False,True,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,True,4.144602851323829,0.8849287169042769,1.3767645133023658,982,0.09410911817649456,0.06938481945404555,0.29660461492665896,0.4534599539715293,0.12424123924893665,0.17741267449138629,https://www.sephora.com/product/u-f-o-ultra-clarifying-face-oil-P410400,0.06067798657962242,445.0,232.0,794.0,1.8028303616251755,0.6207622767817513,0.4080342882834259,0.055882052660313854,138.0,65.0,236.0,280.0,0.6127934431165809,0.4165787938427988,0.07325078744433584,18.0,8.0,31.0,37.0,0.5001138848576876,0.34623268951686065,0.07670548619917307,61.0,27.0,99.0,128.0,0.5904365208409635,0.40927986103748615,0.05417139153460642,195.0,116.0,373.0,463.0,0.5720184176586488,0.35866106573452256,0.08944746053609691,33.0,16.0,55.0,72.0,0.5337894368740628,0.3594908452417157,0.13287095036463722,56.0,25.0,99.0,1.6775351650736292,0.5840174207223435,0.4037651303759412,0.0655515873015873,10.0,8.0,20.0,280.0,0.3371606942825163,0.18731149682362014,0.1983333333333333,3.0,2.0,5.0,37.0,0.23071993220883705,0.1384319593253022,0.3458333333333334,4.0,1.0,5.0,128.0,0.3755282641185389,0.3004226112948311,0.13245005392466333,36.0,14.0,64.0,463.0,0.5833461285401033,0.4200092125488744,0.12911111111111112,3.0,0.0,5.0,72.0,0.4384939195509822,0.4384939195509822,0.05636382801226553,40.0,25.0,80.0,1.240979989187638,0.4938398013143505,0.3039014161934465,0.044809180873995685,12.0,9.0,27.0,280.0,0.3654621629703245,0.20883552169732827,0.1113425925925926,4.0,0.0,4.0,37.0,0.5100999795960008,0.5100999795960008,0.17313368055555556,5.0,1.0,8.0,128.0,0.4364905634363539,0.3637421361969616,0.042161891471102005,18.0,13.0,38.0,463.0,0.4076596435202097,0.2367055994633476,-0.04444444444444445,1.0,2.0,3.0,72.0,0.06149031527616052,0.02049677175872017,0.13815007012338468,177.0,50.0,267.0,1.8995769689941744,0.7214161493316997,0.5625139137960831,0.10299925462609287,39.0,17.0,68.0,280.0,0.5666388751588567,0.3946235023427752,0.08029100529100529,4.0,1.0,7.0,37.0,0.3755282641185389,0.3004226112948311,0.12030235890652555,19.0,6.0,30.0,128.0,0.5656994004476144,0.4299315443401869,0.15203101011748268,103.0,24.0,146.0,463.0,0.7341914043012086,0.5954465719923188,0.21965525793650792,12.0,2.0,16.0,72.0,0.600580922361363,0.5147836477383111,0.07808859341098551,99.0,34.0,139.0,1.7303454881625968,0.6640905808180467,0.4943230639171927,0.07537795199380566,29.0,10.0,41.0,280.0,0.589180432321585,0.4381085265981017,0.22291666666666668,3.0,1.0,4.0,37.0,0.30063605244263664,0.2254770393319775,0.0464861111111111,7.0,2.0,10.0,128.0,0.4525833436728054,0.35200926730107085,0.07749392186452042,50.0,18.0,71.0,463.0,0.6199204078287542,0.4558238292858488,0.06963247863247862,10.0,3.0,13.0,72.0,0.4974312600487309,0.382639430806716,0.302686403508772,11.0,3.0,19.0,1.3103282682215494,0.5241027622679172,0.4117950274962207,0.35,1.0,0.0,2.0,280.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,,,,,37.0,,,0.17833333333333334,1.0,1.0,2.0,128.0,0.09452865480086613,0.047264327400433064,0.3219196428571429,8.0,2.0,14.0,463.0,0.4901568467207234,0.3921254773765788,0.1875,1.0,0.0,1.0,72.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,982,1580.0,411.0,3267.0,216.0,671.0

Solutions for:- Dullness and uneven texture- Fine lines and wrinkles- Uneven skin tone and poresIf you want to know more…This innovative at-home facial contains a whopping 25 percent AHA and two percent BHA blend including the dream team glycolic plus tartaric, lactic, citric, and salicylic acids to gently but efficiently resurface as it exfoliates the pore lining, getting rid of built-up dead skin cells by breaking down the substance that holds them to the surface. Babyfacial™ combines potent antioxidants such as matcha tea, apple fruit, and milk thistle to soothe with ultra-hydrating sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer and non-fragrant plant oils to replenish moisture and nourish skin. They chose chick pea flour over clay for brightening and balancing without over-drying and pumpkin ferment for amazing enzymatic action. Niacinamide, a “cellcommunicating” ingredient, effectively revives a healthy look and feel to skin as it brightens and tones. Appropriate for all skin, Babyfacial™ will dramatically smooth texture, minimize the look of fine lines, wrinkles, and pores, and boost overall clarity-revealing fresh, radiant, baby-soft skin.What else you need to know: Babyfacial™ was created with all skin in mind. Glycolic acids get a bad rap for being sensitizing, but they believe that it’s the pH level and accompanying ingredients (think fragrant oils or high amounts of alcohol) that can be the real problem. They formulated Babyfacial™ at the ideal pH level of 3.5 with a blend of acids that work together synergistically to ensure higher efficacy without the redness and sensitization.Free of essential oils, silicones, and fragrance. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of our formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, and always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels. This is the Drunk Elephant difference.Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.Research results: In an independent consumer testing panel of 104 women ages 25 to 55:- 95% found skin appeared revived- 94% found skin to be deeply cleansed and resurfaced- 93% found skin texture baby-soft - 93% found skin appeared brighter and radiantClean at Sephora When you spot our Clean seal, you can be sure we’ve checked that this brand’s product is made without the ingredients you told us you’d most like to avoid.Clean at Sephora™ is formulated without:Sulfates SLS and SLES, parabens, formaldehydes, formaldehyde-releasing agents, phthalates, mineral oil, retinyl palmitate, oxybenzone, coal tar, hydroquinone, triclosan, triclocarban.

Solutions for:- Fine lines and wrinkles- Dryness If you want to know more…C.E.O. C + E Protect and Repair Moisturizer infuses five percent advanced, oxygen-stable tetrahexydecyl ascorbate (THD ascorbate) into the skin-the gold standard form of vitamin C. THD ascorbate is the newer, clinically-proven, oil-soluble derivative of vitamin C, which penetrates better into the skin while being exceptionally stable against oxygenation. With 5 percent THD ascorbate, this moisturizer is powerful at fighting the first visible signs of aging and restoring vital skin radiance, while being uniquely suitable for those with sensitive skin, as THD ascorbate is significantly less irritating than other forms of vitamin C. Once in the skin, it helps boost youthful-looking skin texture and volume, in addition to providing photostable, antioxidant support. Blended with protective, anti-pollution expopolysaccharides and refining lime pearl extract, this formula visibly repairs the effects of aging, environmental stress, and pollution-induced damage. It is rich yet never greasy, providing hydration and antioxidant protection to the skin for a visibly younger, softer, and healthier-looking complexion.

Solutions for:- Fine lines and wrinkles- Loss of firmness and elasticity If you want to know more… Shaba Complex™ Eye Serum contains potent doses of black tea ferment and copper peptides that work together to support a firmer-looking appearance around the eyes, helping to slow down the signs aging before they appear. A unique combination of edelweiss stem cells and niacinamide helps diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. The powerful antioxidants in Co-Q10 help diminish signs of premature aging from environmental aggressors while also helping to fade the appearance of age spots. You won’t believe your eyes. What else you need to know: Shaba Complex™ Eye Serum uses ingredients to tackle the issues, not cover them up. Shaba is formulated with a pH level of 5.8 and does not contain light deflectors commonly used to trick the eye. Free of essential oils, silicones, and fragrance. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of our formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, and always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels. This is the Drunk Elephant difference. Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.

The formula features two types of vitamin C: a water-soluble vitamin C derivative that absorbs quickly for an immediate glow and an oil-soluble vitamin C derivative that remains in skin longer, providing antioxidant protection from UV damage for a brighter, more even-toned appearance over time. The mask is also powered by the Japanese beautyberry, a superfruit rich in antioxidants that was found to stabilize vitamin C, maximizing its effectiveness. A gentle 10 percent AHA complex of seven fruits removes debris and the buildup of dead skin cells to visibly improve skin texture and support the natural production of new skin cells. Tatcha's signature trio of Japanese anti-aging superfoods-green tea, rice, and algae-helps to restore a more youthful appearance. What else you need to know:One of the geisha’s most beloved beauty secrets for radiant skin was a face pack-an intensive rinse-off treatment made from fresh fruits and botanicals. This time-tested practice inspired the Violet-C Radiance Mask, a modern treatment for smooth, glowing skin. This product is non-irritating, non-sensitizing, dermatologist tested, and cruelty-free. It is formulated without mineral oil, synthetic fragrances, sulfate detergents, urea, DEA, or TEA.Beauty that gives back: every Tatcha purchase you make supports girls’ education around the world.

This Super Serum is the fundamental first step, before any other skincare product, for a revitalizing effect.

What it is formulated WITHOUT:- Parabens- Sulfates- Phthalates What else you need to know: The source of the Red Hibiscus is the Dior Garden located in the heart of the Koro Ecological and Cultural Site. In this garden, covering 20 hectares, nearly 190 plant species flourish, representing an astonishing 18 percent of all species found in Burkina Faso. This remarkable site was selected due to its distinctive geology and the richness of its soil. More than a hectare is entirely devoted to cultivating the hibiscus sabdariffa, or red hibiscus. The Dior Research Center studied the red hibiscus flower and discovered extraordinary detoxifying power. Red hibiscus extract has been shown to stimulate the recycling process of toxins that have penetrated the cell's lung. One Essential quadruples the effects of active ingredients in the skincare products that follow (in vitro test on different major anti-aging ingredients) like retinol, vitamin C, longoza, hyaluronic acid, and bifidus for lasting radiance.

Solutions for: - Fine lines and wrinkles - Dullness and uneven texture - Dryness If you want to know more… Fresh Crème Ancienne is a couture, ageless complexion cream that provides long-lasting hydration while immediately smoothing the look of wrinkles. Handmade in a monastery, this ultra-effective formula is proven to reduce the appearance of wrinkles in depth and length, providing a significant, anti-oxidative effect for 24 hours-delivering instant and long-lasting hydration. The face cream is hand-blended with meadowfoam seed oil, a unique fatty acid absorbed by the skin to provide the ultimate nourishment. A dose of vitamin E provides antioxidant protection against wrinkle-causing free radicals, while chamomile wax decreases dry spots, softens the skin, and imparts a light moisture-preserving veil. What it is formulated WITHOUT: - Parabens - Sulfates - Phthalates What else you need to know: ""Inspired by the world's first cream, Crème Ancienne contains such fragile ingredients that each must be poured in a particular sequence at a specific dose at a determined temperature all in perfect balance-requirements that can only be met by hand. We turned to a monastery to hand-blend each jar because monks are an important part of the cream's heritage. Historically, if a formula was not produced by a monk, it was considered witchcraft. Without them, the original formula would not exist today.""-Lev Glazman and Alina Roytberg, Fresh Co-founders Research results: In-vivo test: - Proven to have a significant moisturizing effect for 28 hours - Proven to have a significant anti-oxidative effect for 24 hours - Proven to have an immediate smoothing effect on wrinkles - 97% felt it moisturized and prevented dry skin - 90% noticed a nourishing effect",False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,True,4.2574257425742585,0.9801980198019802,1.2857174288819038,101,-0.4005473614707432,0.24178390861195434,-0.32243665751037404,0.30547602424207865,0.03594575210931439,0.02980680662150888,https://www.sephora.com/product/creme-ancienne-P42592,0.005101867439830403,14.0,10.0,27.0,1.8028303616251755,0.3883433764938864,0.2265336362881004,0.027002984389348016,5.0,5.0,11.0,33.0,0.2365895936154873,0.11829479680774364,0.3,2.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,0.3423719528896193,0.3423719528896193,-1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.02686213991769547,5.0,2.0,9.0,29.0,0.3589290901482127,0.2563779215344376,-0.00026041666666667957,2.0,2.0,4.0,29.0,0.15003570882017145,0.07501785441008572,0.15961805555555558,5.0,3.0,10.0,1.6775351650736292,0.3057378545838018,0.19108615911487611,0.15000000000000002,1.0,1.0,3.0,33.0,0.09452865480086613,0.047264327400433064,-0.15,0.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,2.0,,,-0.009722222222222224,0.0,1.0,2.0,29.0,0.0,0.0,0.32890625,4.0,0.0,4.0,29.0,0.5100999795960008,0.5100999795960008,-0.02625,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.240979989187638,0.09452865480086613,0.047264327400433064,,,,,33.0,,,,,,,8.0,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,29.0,,,-0.02625,1.0,1.0,3.0,29.0,0.09452865480086613,0.047264327400433064,0.11802770146520145,20.0,6.0,26.0,1.8995769689941744,0.5794807424804321,0.44575441729264015,0.08993055555555554,6.0,1.0,7.0,33.0,0.4868654966809702,0.417313282869403,0.2125,1.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,-1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.1338888888888889,3.0,2.0,5.0,29.0,0.23071993220883705,0.1384319593253022,0.2131051587301587,10.0,2.0,12.0,29.0,0.5519636426153274,0.4599697021794395,0.0733643728956229,15.0,5.0,24.0,1.7303454881625968,0.5312949900419365,0.3984712425314524,0.014062500000000006,4.0,2.0,8.0,33.0,0.2999883213415286,0.1999922142276857,0.11818181818181818,1.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,,,,,2.0,,,0.027111111111111117,3.0,1.0,5.0,29.0,0.30063605244263664,0.2254770393319775,0.1394507575757576,7.0,2.0,10.0,29.0,0.4525833436728054,0.35200926730107085,0.0851748106060606,10.0,6.0,20.0,1.3103282682215494,0.3864064709793481,0.2415040443620925,0.08871133207070707,5.0,2.0,8.0,33.0,0.3589290901482127,0.2563779215344376,0.3055555555555556,1.0,0.0,1.0,8.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,,,,,2.0,,,0.04957142857142857,2.0,3.0,7.0,29.0,0.11761823115925325,0.0470472924637013,0.0853125,2.0,1.0,4.0,29.0,0.20765495512648788,0.1384366367509919,101,209.0,191.0,156.0,46.0,7.0

Free of SLS, fragrance, and essential oils, Beste™ No. 9 is totally non-irritating, non-sensitizing, and appropriate for all skin. Solutions for:- Oiliness- Makeup removal If you want to know more…With a unique blend of mild surfactants and makeup-dissolving emollients, this gentle formula rinses away without an ounce of residue, leaving skin clean and soft. What else you need to know:Beste™ No. 9 is formulated at an ideal, non-stripping pH level of 5.5. 100 percent free of essential oils, silicones, and fragrance. Note: In Afrikaans, Beste means Best. Even though the first eight versions weren’t exactly that, Drunk Elephant thinks they’ve finally found the best one yet. They are calling it Beste™ No. 9 after going through nine formulations to get there! Only the Beste will do. Note from Tiffany Masterson, Drunk Elephant Founder: ""We took your feedback about the original Beste and made some changes-we swapped out the twist top packaging for a trusty flip top and tweaked the formula so it’s gentle enough to use on eyes (and remove every last trace of makeup)."" Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of our formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, and always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels.

What else you need to know: Think of Protini™ in your Drunk Elephant skincare routine like adding a shot of protein to your smoothie. Abundant with proteins and nutrients, and formulated at a pH level of four, it replenishes and gives your skin a strong, healthy appearance. ""Hi all! Every day, I add protein powder to my smoothie for muscle support. I wanted a different kind of moisturizer that would do the same for my collagen-help support, maintain, and possibly prevent the breakdown of existing. Protini was born. Jam-packed with crazy levels of amino acids, signal peptides, and safe, synthetic growth factors (the good kind), this dreamy cream melts right into your skin to make it hydrated, bouncy, and balanced. I’m hoping you’ll fall #drunkinlove!""-Tiffany Masterson, Founder of Drunk Elephant Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of our formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, and always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels. This is the Drunk Elephant difference. Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free. Research results: In an independent consumer testing panel of 50 women age 25 to 55: - 100% agreed their skin felt replenished and nourished - 97% agreed their skin felt moisturized - 97% agreed their skin texture felt soft and smooth - 88% agreed their skin was strengthened - 85% agreed their skin looked plumped and youthful - 73% agreed their skin felt firmer and elastic Clean at Sephora When you spot our Clean seal, you can be sure we’ve checked that this brand’s product is made without the ingredients you told us you’d most like to avoid.Clean at Sephora™ is formulated without:Sulfates SLS and SLES, parabens, formaldehydes, formaldehyde-releasing agents, phthalates, mineral oil, retinyl palmitate, oxybenzone, coal tar, hydroquinone, triclosan, triclocarban.

Solutions for: - Fine lines and wrinkles - Loss of firmness and elasticity - Dullness and uneven texture If you want to know more…This power-packed serum is a natural and effective time machine for the skin. It reenergizes sluggish skin cells so they act younger and perform their critical functions, like natural collagen synthesis more effectively. With every application, skin cells work faster and harder to firm, tone, brighten, and smooth. Or in other words, return skin to its most youthful state. This serum is formulated with Caudalie’s three signature patents: resveratrol to visibly lift and firm, Viniferine® to brighten, and grape seed polyphenols to protect against environmental aggressors. Together, these powerhouse ingredients further enhance the serum’s anti-aging benefits and boost the effectiveness of any subsequent cream. The formula is further enriched with niacinimide (vitamin B3) to protect skin from UV damage, age spots, and hyperpigmentation, as well as boost hydration and act as an anti-inflammatory. The silky, weightless texture glides over skin and absorbs quickly and features a subtle, natural rose scent. What else you need to know: Powering this support in skin cell energy is Vinergy®, a breakthrough anti-aging complex co-patented with Harvard Medical School. It took five years to perfect the Vinergy formula, which is exclusive to this innovative serum. ""For the past five years, I have collaborated with Caudalie to research and develop ground-breaking, anti-aging innovations. Together we've discovered a solution to counteract the diminishing energy metabolism of our cells over time, which is a key reason our skin ages. Our groundbreaking discovery of vinergy helps to restore the cells' mitochondrial mass and energy production, which in turn allows our cells to defend against aging.""-Dr. David Sinclair, Harvard Medical School This product is vegan, non-toxic, cruelty-free, hypoallergenic, safe for sensitive skin and pregnancy, and free all fillers, gluten, and GMOs.

It cleanses with amino acids derived from silk gentle enough for even the most delicate skin, leaving skin soft, refreshed, and comfortably hydrated. The formula harnesses the power of the Japanese luffa fruit, a natural beauty multitasker beloved by Japanese women for centuries. Ground fibers from the fruit exfoliate, helping to turn over dead skin cells while purifying and decongesting pores. The fruit extract also beautifies and conditions skin. Japanese wild rose works to visibly tighten pores and smooth skin texture, while Japanese leopard lily helps minimize excess oil.What else you need to know: Harvested under a full autumn moon, the water of luffa fruit has been prized as a favorite natural skincare ingredient in Japan since the Edo period. It is beloved for its clarifying and moisturizing properties.

The Deep Cleanse harnesses this time-tested ingredient in this refreshing, easy-to-use daily exfoliating cleanser.This pure, oil-free formula is non-irritating, non-sensitizing, dermatologist tested, and cruelty-free.

Vitamins alleviate dryness, provide anti-wrinkle benefits, and soothe as essential minerals support healthy-looking skin tone and texture. Five potent peptides help visibly restore damaged skin.What it is formulated WITHOUT:- Parabens- Sulfates- PhthalatesWhat else you need to know:This product features limited-edition Hydration packaging to celebrate Murad’s 30-year anniversary as the skincare hydration experts. Just a dime-sized amount of Nutrient-Charged Water Gel provides enough hydration for wearing alone, or underneath your SPF and makeup. It is cruelty-free, and formulated without gluten and animal-derived ingredients.There are many factors that contribute to a damaged skin barrier, including emotional stress, fatigue, dehydration, pollution, and over-exfoliation. When the barrier is damaged, skin experiences redness, dryness, and tightness. However, when the barrier is healthy, skin appears even-toned, clear, smooth, and balanced. ""‘Eat your water’ is a phrase I have been using for many years. Staying sufficiently hydrated isn’t just about drinking eight glasses of water a day. When we eat more water-rich foods, we absorb water more slowly because it is trapped in the nutritional structure of these foods. Slow absorption means that water in food stays in our bodies longer to optimize hydration. The same rule applies to skin. Applying nutrient-rich ingredients will strengthen the skin barrier and help our skin trap and hold onto more water, longer. That’s how the formula for Nutrient-Charged Water Gel was born.""-Howard Murad, M.D., FAAD Research results:Clinically tested by an independent laboratory and proven safe for sensitive skin. Based on a technology-tested clinical study of 20 people, after 3 weeks of continuous use:- 100% showed skin barrier repair in 30 minutes- Locks moisture to skin and increases retention for up to 5 days-Takes skin from dry to hydrated with just 1 use (clinically tested and proven via 3D Moisture Mapping Technology)",False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,True,4.391089108910891,0.8712871287128713,1.0464437773166668,202,-0.08881079254147344,0.4029315949426913,-0.041080067219691783,0.05518533471717981,-0.27427755736693804,0.18508680620011614,https://www.sephora.com/product/nutrient-charged-water-gel-P427638,0.08320795058599935,22.0,13.0,41.0,1.8028303616251755,0.4633664048802107,0.29125888306756104,0.04998784428132254,11.0,8.0,23.0,112.0,0.3627555146516011,0.21001635058776907,0.01875000000000001,1.0,1.0,4.0,30.0,0.09452865480086613,0.047264327400433064,0.27114197530864204,8.0,1.0,9.0,22.0,0.5649937852319398,0.5022166979839464,,,,,1.0,,,-0.05069444444444445,2.0,3.0,5.0,37.0,0.11761823115925325,0.0470472924637013,0.14232905982905986,9.0,1.0,13.0,1.6775351650736292,0.5958436145024277,0.536259253052185,0.1490740740740741,5.0,1.0,6.0,112.0,0.4364905634363539,0.3637421361969616,0.15,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,22.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,0.16116666666666665,3.0,0.0,5.0,37.0,0.4384939195509822,0.4384939195509822,0.07515782828282831,2.0,3.0,6.0,1.240979989187638,0.11761823115925325,0.0470472924637013,-0.1125,0.0,1.0,2.0,112.0,0.0,0.0,0.5666666666666668,1.0,0.0,1.0,30.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,,,,,22.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,0.03642676767676769,1.0,2.0,3.0,37.0,0.06149031527616052,0.02049677175872017,0.2535056038181038,61.0,6.0,74.0,1.8995769689941744,0.8180703630060067,0.744810330498006,0.2591800729300729,30.0,2.0,37.0,112.0,0.7985253275199642,0.7486174945499664,0.25335648148148143,13.0,1.0,15.0,30.0,0.6853073044604219,0.6363567827132489,0.21407407407407408,7.0,2.0,9.0,22.0,0.4525833436728054,0.35200926730107085,,,,,1.0,,,0.26482600732600736,11.0,1.0,13.0,37.0,0.6461140782014047,0.5922712383512876,0.14766385003885005,18.0,5.0,26.0,1.7303454881625968,0.5809611981726508,0.4546652855264224,0.08686734006734008,10.0,3.0,15.0,112.0,0.4974312600487309,0.382639430806716,0.2686944444444445,4.0,1.0,5.0,30.0,0.3755282641185389,0.3004226112948311,0.3041666666666667,3.0,0.0,4.0,22.0,0.4384939195509822,0.4384939195509822,,,,,1.0,,,-0.011944444444444436,1.0,1.0,2.0,37.0,0.09452865480086613,0.047264327400433064,0.17842261904761905,6.0,0.0,7.0,1.3103282682215494,0.6096569663469354,0.6096569663469354,0.1805555555555556,2.0,0.0,3.0,112.0,0.3423719528896193,0.3423719528896193,0.1871527777777778,3.0,0.0,3.0,30.0,0.4384939195509822,0.4384939195509822,,,,,22.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,0.14583333333333334,1.0,0.0,1.0,37.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,202,503.0,148.0,4.0,159.0,116.0

Solutions for: - Pores - Acne and blemishes - Oiliness If you want to know more…Enlarged and clogged pores got you tossing and turning? Rest easy-Peace Out Pores will minimize and prevent them in no time. These two-in-one detoxifying strips contain absorptive hydrocolloid technology to lift away dirt, excess sebum, and dead skin cells. Pore-minimizing DMAE extracts trapped oil and helps visibly shrink enlarged pores. Once oil and impurities have been sucked into the strip, vitamin A helps refine skin texture and prevent blackheads from forming. The best part? Waking up confident in your smoother, clearer skin. This set contains:- 4 x Pore strips - 4 x Blackhead strips What it is formulated WITHOUT:- Parabens- Sulfates- Phthalates What else you need to know: This product is noncomedogenic, cruelty-free, and formulated without latex. Peace Out is reinventing the vintage pore strip with the best new skin technology. Unlike other pore strips that rip off only the top of blackheads, Peace Out Pores’ patent-pending design unclogs pores by absorbing all of the oil trapped inside, then visibly shrinks enlarged pores with powerful but non-drying active ingredients. Most pore strips leave pores open and large, making it easy for them to fill up with oil and form new blackheads. Peace Out’s one-step, leave-on pore treatment helps prevent the formation of new blackheads by keeping the pores tight and free of excess oil and dirt.

Solutions for: - Fine lines and wrinkles - Dullness and uneven texture - Loss of firmness and elasticity If you want to know more… Capture Youth offers five targeted serums to meet the specific needs of each skin type. Enriched with antioxidant-rich iris extract, each serum is infused with a naturally-derived active ingredient to target and treat a specific skin concern: dullness, dryness, lack of firmness, oily skin, and redness. These serums are formulated to be used with the universal antioxidant cream for maximum efficacy. - Glow Booster Serum (to target dullness): vitamin C and AHA combine to brighten and even skin. - Plump Filler Serum (for dryness/lack of density): hyaluronic acid from fermented wheat hydrates and replenishes the skin to make it appear fuller and more supple. - Lift Sculptor Serum (for lack of firmness/wrinkles): polyphenols derived from a tea blend boost elastin production to visibly lift and sculpt the skin for firmer, more defined skin contours. - Matte Maximizer Serum (for oily skin): lactic acid derived from sugar cane regulates excess sebum to help reduce shine and refine pores. - Redness Soother Serum (for red, irritated skin): natural peptides from cotton reduce redness and irritation for a smoother, more even complexion. - Intense Rescue Age-Delay Revitalizing Oil-Serum (for dry, dehydrated skin): intensive, lipid-replenishing oil-serum that strengthens the skin's natural barrier to help repair dryness on the skin's surface and maintain hydration.

So, what we put on our body is just as important as what we put in it. Edible Beauty Australia’s gold standard for purity is an edible ingredient list. This means they use only food-grade ingredients to create their range of therapeutic, wildcrafted, botanical skincare. Products are free of alcohol, fragrance, propylene glycol, preservatives, colors, and synthetics, and come packaged in Miron violet glass, which filters damaging UV rays while preserving and activating the botanical ingredients found inside. Wildcrafted: the use of Australian wildcrafted botanicals raises the therapeutic profile of each and every formula. Found growing in remote and arid regions of Australia, these plants are forced to develop a strong antioxidant defense and preservation system to survive. When used topically, these qualities transfer to your skin, in the form of potent anti-aging, protective, nourishing, and hydrating benefits.

Solutions for: - Dark circles and puffiness - Fine lines and wrinkles - If you want to know more… Gold leaf imparts a luminous glow, supports natural cellular turnover, and visibly smooths fine lines and wrinkles. A revitalizing trio of coffee, cucumber, and horsetail extracts diminish the appearance of dark circles and puffiness. This velvety eye balm also contains antioxidant-rich botanicals-including blueberry, linden flower, and passionflower-that energize, nourish, and restore youthful-looking radiance. What else you need to know: This product is vegan, formulated without gluten, hypoallergenic, and cruelty-free. It is suitable for women who are pregnant and breastfeeding. Edible: skin absorbs 60 percent of the substances that we place on it. So, what we put on our body is just as important as what we put in it. Edible Beauty Australia’s gold standard for purity is an edible ingredient list. This means they use only food-grade ingredients to create their range of therapeutic, wildcrafted, botanical skincare. Products are free of alcohol, fragrance, propylene glycol, preservatives, colors, and synthetics, and come packaged in Miron violet glass, which filters damaging UV rays while preserving and activating the botanical ingredients found inside. Wildcrafted: the use of Australian wildcrafted botanicals raises the therapeutic profile of each and every formula. Found growing in remote and arid regions of Australia, these plants are forced to develop a strong antioxidant defense and preservation system to survive. When used topically, these qualities transfer to your skin, in the form of potent anti-aging, protective, nourishing, and hydrating benefits.

They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what Drunk Elephant calls the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin.

Their advanced organic formula is light-as-air yet protects against broad spectrum UVA/UVB, IR (infrared), and HEV (high energy visible) Light, meaning they’ve got you covered from beach to board meeting. A fast-absorbing complex blend of plant stem cells and patented LightWaves Defense [JS+M] technology helps to prevent visible signs of aging from both indoor and outdoor daily aggressors. Finally, full spectrum organic skincare that keeps up with your everyday modern lifestyle! What else you need to know:This product is formulated without oxybenzone.

HEV light and infrared (IR) light can lead to premature aging and skin damage from the blue-violet and invisible light emitted from electronic devices such as tablets, computers, and smartphones. They penetrate more deeply into layers of skin than the sun's UV rays, thus accelerating aging. Take the necessary steps to protect your skin from not only UV rays, but also damaging electronic lights.

Solutions for:- Dryness- Dullness and uneven texture- Fine lines and wrinklesIf you want to know more… Inspired by a classical Japanese beauty treatment of steaming strips of leftover kimono silk over enriched natural elixirs, this mask imparts a glow. The secret is a blend of lightweight rice germ oil-derived from the most nutrient-rich portion of rice packed with vitamin E and essential fatty acids-and a high concentration of botanical oils and extracts. It nourishes skin from within, leaving it velvety smooth, dewy, and luminous. The mask drenches skin with hydration. The delicate ultra-fine microfiber sheet, 100 times thinner than a strand of hair, delivers 20 ml of serum into skin for maximum absorption and benefits. The mask feeds skin with Japanese anti-aging superfoods such as a fermentation of green tea, rice, and algae-ingredients at the heart of the Japanese diet and time-tested skincare rituals-that restore skin health and youthful radiance.

It delivers rich hydration, conditions damaged skin, soothes acne-prone skin, and helps improve the look of the overall skin complexion.This elixir is rich in antioxidant and skin-calming properties, making it ideal for conditioning dry skin and eczema. The naturally earthy aroma of the tamanu oil explodes in the Volcanic Elixir as it's unmasked by filler ingredients or artificial fragrances. It's 100-percent real, raw, and natural.This Polynesian beauty oil is extracted from the nut kernels of the tamanu fruit-which flourishes in the islands of the South Pacific, thanks to the volcanic atmosphere there. Not only does volcanic ash provide nutrients to surrounding soil, but it also contains minerals that are beneficial to plants. Due to this very reason, the tamanu oil originating from Polynesia contains the highest nutritional value.Volcanic Elixir can also be used on the face or body as a daily moisturizer.What it is formulated WITHOUT:- Parabens- Sulfates- PhthalatesWhat else you need to know:This product is vegan, gluten-free, cruelty-free, and free of synthetic fragrances.",False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,4.131944444444445,0.7708333333333334,1.3392750767328312,144,0.6386316710838321,0.2394175014497335,-0.05181454117051496,0.3174679608616601,0.052813145418750304,0.01989064862917013,https://www.sephora.com/product/volcanic-elixir-P430714,0.05118467483794864,32.0,17.0,63.0,1.8028303616251755,0.5131093521943978,0.33509182184123937,0.026032407407407414,14.0,10.0,30.0,65.0,0.3883433764938864,0.2265336362881004,0.05357142857142857,3.0,0.0,7.0,18.0,0.4384939195509822,0.4384939195509822,0.05662213654401154,8.0,3.0,14.0,26.0,0.4343497069897538,0.3158906959925482,0.1,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.10690476190476192,6.0,4.0,11.0,33.0,0.3126695474501863,0.18760172847011175,0.16530629960317458,8.0,5.0,16.0,1.6775351650736292,0.3552248097226855,0.21859988290626803,0.0822420634920635,3.0,2.0,7.0,65.0,0.23071993220883705,0.1384319593253022,0.8,1.0,0.0,1.0,18.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.2716666666666667,3.0,1.0,4.0,26.0,0.30063605244263664,0.2254770393319775,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,,,0.060846560846560836,1.0,2.0,3.0,33.0,0.06149031527616052,0.02049677175872017,0.07755555555555556,3.0,2.0,5.0,1.240979989187638,0.23071993220883705,0.1384319593253022,0.3438888888888889,2.0,0.0,2.0,65.0,0.3423719528896193,0.3423719528896193,,,,,18.0,,,-0.25,0.0,1.0,1.0,26.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,-0.25,0.0,1.0,1.0,33.0,0.0,0.0,0.19124555281882866,23.0,3.0,29.0,1.8995769689941744,0.7102370691310167,0.6282866380774378,0.2314751221001221,12.0,1.0,13.0,65.0,0.6668546607175265,0.61555814835464,0.12402777777777778,3.0,1.0,6.0,18.0,0.30063605244263664,0.2254770393319775,0.2362962962962963,6.0,0.0,6.0,26.0,0.6096569663469354,0.6096569663469354,-0.5,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.2916666666666667,2.0,0.0,3.0,33.0,0.3423719528896193,0.3423719528896193,0.14253146701388889,13.0,2.0,16.0,1.7303454881625968,0.6211750079348376,0.538351673543526,0.19352430555555555,7.0,0.0,8.0,65.0,0.6456611570247934,0.6456611570247934,0.14036458333333332,1.0,0.0,1.0,18.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.375,1.0,0.0,1.0,26.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,,,,,2.0,,,0.036157407407407416,4.0,2.0,6.0,33.0,0.2999883213415286,0.1999922142276857,0.2576231060606061,3.0,0.0,4.0,1.3103282682215494,0.4384939195509822,0.4384939195509822,0.14375,1.0,0.0,2.0,65.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.37149621212121214,2.0,0.0,2.0,18.0,0.3423719528896193,0.3423719528896193,,,,,26.0,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,33.0,,,144,300.0,138.0,17.0,94.0,136.0

It is boosted by niacinamide, which is known to visibly brighten and firm. Silk powder smooths the look of fine lines and imperfections, while a blend of botanical extracts protects from makeup and pollution that can cause signs of aging. The lightweight cream is powered by hadasei-3, a proprietary trio of Japanese anti-aging superfoods, and hyaluronic acid nourishes and hydrates for a plump, refreshed appearance.

Solutions for:- Acne and blemishes- Fine lines and wrinkles- Dullness and uneven textureIf you want to know more…Exfoliation is an enormously vital part of any skincare routine, but not all exfoliation is equal. Chemical exfoliation (the use of naturally-occurring acids to remove dead skin cells, usually AHAs or BHAs) tends to give a far more thorough, even result than scrubbing your face with harsh, jagged particles. Which is why Go-To Skincare prefers it. Combining the effectiveness of lactic acid, the most gentle of all AHAs, with ultra-hydrating essential oils, these Exfoliating Swipeys thoroughly remove dead skin cells (the cause of dull skin and congestion), refine skin texture, minimize the appearance of fine lines, and moisturize. And all in 60 seconds-using just one sweet, disposable little cotton pad. What else you need to know: When using AHA products, wearing daily sunscreen becomes even more crucial.

A concentrated mix of protective antioxidants boosts skin’s defenses against pollution and environmental stressors.. D-Bronzi’s just-got-back-from-somewhere glow flatters every complexion. It’s an easy way to get a bronzy glow without the long-term consequences.What else you need to know: Raw, unrefined cocoa powder adds an infusion of good-for-skin polyphenols, platinum peptide acetyl tetrapeptide-17 strengthens, and a chronopeptide mimics the antioxidant benefits of vitamin D. ""I’m inside most days. I don’t wear foundation, but I really wanted a little something I could mix into my other products to give my skin some color. The problem was I didn’t want to risk a breakout and I couldn’t find one that fit my Suspicious 6-free criteria. So, after a few attempts, we landed on a silky, natural-looking, bronzing concentrate. My chemist told me later that they were high-fiving each other in the lab because they had never before been able to create a formulation like this that was silicone-free. D-Bronzi™ is made of vitamins, antioxidants, platinum peptides, and barrier-supportive fatty acids that defend skin from environmental free radicals. It’s a gorgeous sheer bronzer that I formulated with skin health top-of-mind...like sunshine in a bottle without the damage. I hope you fall #drunkinlove!""-Tiffany Masterson, Brand FounderFree of essential oils, silicones, and fragrance.Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what Drunk Elephant calls the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels. This is the Drunk Elephant difference.Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.

""Cultural Stress™ is the unnecessary man-made stress we put on ourselves in our attempt to live up to everyone’s expectations. Our hyper-connected, fast-paced society triggers a constant flood of damaging stress hormones, like cortisol, that fatigue our bodies and could show in our skin as dehydration, sallowness, roughness, and deep expression lines. The best way to manage stress is through balance, and I formulated Revitalixir™ Recovery Serum with a balancing blend of relaxing and reviving extracts to help manage the visible effects of stress, minimize skin fatigue, and renew vibrancy in an instant and over time.""-Howard Murad, M.D., FAAD Research results:Clinically tested by an independent laboratory and proven safe for sensitive skin.",False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,True,4.1858407079646005,0.831858407079646,1.2503476128544906,113,-0.642674694625791,0.5101585349664979,-0.15961187767633406,0.4635652415346686,-0.07414945387041147,0.2824304018459175,https://www.sephora.com/product/revitalixir-tm-recovery-serum-P434550,0.029008264462809925,11.0,6.0,22.0,1.8028303616251755,0.4129996672121183,0.26723507878431185,0.020485209235209245,7.0,4.0,14.0,64.0,0.35379677689163724,0.2251434034764964,0.06527777777777778,2.0,0.0,2.0,16.0,0.3423719528896193,0.3423719528896193,0.075,1.0,0.0,2.0,9.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,,,,,,,,0.017708333333333333,1.0,2.0,4.0,24.0,0.06149031527616052,0.02049677175872017,0.14959168146668148,25.0,7.0,39.0,1.6775351650736292,0.6124466920955516,0.4784739781996497,0.22109900698716486,14.0,2.0,19.0,64.0,0.6397666856325172,0.5597958499284525,0.031875000000000014,3.0,2.0,6.0,16.0,0.23071993220883705,0.1384319593253022,-0.05833333333333333,2.0,1.0,3.0,9.0,0.20765495512648788,0.1384366367509919,,,,,,,,0.1469949494949495,6.0,2.0,11.0,24.0,0.4092698791025892,0.3069524093269419,0.18857060185185187,5.0,1.0,8.0,1.240979989187638,0.4364905634363539,0.3637421361969616,0.13333333333333336,1.0,0.0,2.0,64.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.34375,1.0,0.0,1.0,16.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.22500000000000006,2.0,0.0,2.0,9.0,0.3423719528896193,0.3423719528896193,,,,,,,,0.14938271604938272,1.0,1.0,3.0,24.0,0.09452865480086613,0.047264327400433064,0.22488544505905625,28.0,5.0,36.0,1.8995769689941744,0.6907978686153953,0.5861315248857899,0.24838143338143334,17.0,3.0,21.0,64.0,0.6395767041130426,0.5436401984960861,0.12072916666666668,3.0,0.0,4.0,16.0,0.4384939195509822,0.4384939195509822,0.3184734247234247,4.0,0.0,4.0,9.0,0.5100999795960008,0.5100999795960008,,,,,,,,0.16043650793650796,4.0,2.0,7.0,24.0,0.2999883213415286,0.1999922142276857,0.07241452991452993,10.0,3.0,13.0,1.7303454881625968,0.4974312600487309,0.382639430806716,0.0704513888888889,7.0,1.0,8.0,64.0,0.5291051942301385,0.4629670449513712,0.2305555555555556,2.0,0.0,2.0,16.0,0.3423719528896193,0.3423719528896193,,,,,9.0,,,,,,,,,,-0.02777777777777778,1.0,2.0,3.0,24.0,0.06149031527616052,0.02049677175872017,0.2027579365079365,13.0,1.0,19.0,1.3103282682215494,0.6853073044604219,0.6363567827132489,0.06501736111111113,2.0,1.0,8.0,64.0,0.20765495512648788,0.1384366367509919,0.2800925925925926,3.0,0.0,3.0,16.0,0.4384939195509822,0.4384939195509822,0.3607142857142857,2.0,0.0,2.0,9.0,0.3423719528896193,0.3423719528896193,,,,,,,,0.29509259259259263,6.0,0.0,6.0,24.0,0.6096569663469354,0.6096569663469354,113,300.0,108.0,,58.0,38.0

Solutions for: - Fine lines and wrinkles - Loss of firmness and elasticity - Dullness and uneven texture If you want to know more…This award-winning, bestselling serum replenishes the body’s own natural supply of EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor) and rejuvenates skin cells, thus helping to slow the aging process. From birth until adulthood, our bodies manufacture copious amounts of proteins called growth factors that communicate with cells, sending messages to repair, rejuvenate, and so on. EGF is one of the most important growth factor for skin cells, helping them to boost production of collagen and elastin and increase the skin’s capacity to retain water to maintain healthy, youthful and dense skin. When we reach maturity, production of growth factors diminishes. As a result, cell turnover and repair slows, eventually affecting our appearance. In fact, skin density thins by one percent each year after we turn twenty, and it is further reduced by up to 30 percent during menopause. Skin starts to sag and fine lines and wrinkles appear. There are many factors that play a role in skin aging and some are beyond our control, like genetics. We can, however, lead a healthy lifestyle, protect our skin from the sun, and use effective anti-aging skincare products. What else you need to know: This serum contains only seven ingredients; no preservatives or additives. The bottle may be small but the serum inside is incredibly potent and long-lasting. You only need two to four drops per nighttime use to see visible, lasting results. The barley-based EGF is uniquely pure and grown in an ecologically-engineered greenhouse in Iceland with a negative CO2 footprint.

Solutions for: - Dryness- Dullness and uneven texture- Redness If you want to know more…REN Clean Skincare’s Evercalm™ Overnight Recovery Balm uses enzymatically activated oils (sourced from olive, almond, borage, and linseed) to nourish from within and stimulate lipid production to help skin help itself.

Solutions for: - Fine lines and wrinkles - Puffiness - Dark circles If you want to know more… Pure colloidal silver helps encourage skin rejuvenation to give the look of 10 hours of rest after just 10 minutes of application. A customer-fave, stay-in-place cooling eye gel patches help de-puff, brighten, and fill in the appearance of fine lines by improving micro-circulation and infusing the delicate under-eye area with calming aloe. Illuminating pearl helps eyes instantly appear brighter while natural collagen helps firm and tighten. Individually packaged so you can keep a set in the fridge, at your desk, in your makeup bag, and next to your passport for long flights, it may also be used on nose-to-mouth lines. What it is formulated WITHOUT:- Parabens- Sulfates- Phthalates What else you need to know: To enhance results, apply Bright Eyes immediately after treating skin with GloPRO® Microneedling Facial Regeneration Tool and EYE MicroTip™ Attachment Head so that skin can drink in the active ingredients. ""I selfishly developed our cooling colloidal silver eye gels to accommodate my crazy travel schedule that began wreaking time-zone havoc on my tired eyes. I had already fallen in love with the known healing benefits of oral colloidal silver (try a few drops on your tongue when sick) and knew it was the perfect ingredient to calm topical inflammation, help magnify the repair process after a GloPRO microneedling treatment around the eye area, and instantly make three hours of sleep look like 10 hours in just minutes. I never travel without these for overnight flights, I usually throw a pair on while making breakfast in the morning and am regularly seen wearing them around the office (yep, can even be worn over makeup). I’ve even used these eye gels to immediately repair eyelid irritation after an allergic reaction to an eyeshadow. I made sure each was individually packaged (with lots of extra yummy serum inside to massage into the skin after removing eye gels) so you can take them on the go and never worry about them drying out. I recently brought a box to a girl’s night in and it was the perfect sharable favor.

They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, and always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels. This is the Drunk Elephant difference. Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.

Ingredient Callouts: Free of sulfates SLS and SLES, parabens, formaldehydes, formaldehyde-releasing agents, phthalates, mineral oil, retinyl palmitate, oxybenzone, coal tar, hydroquinone, triclosan, and triclocarban, and contains less than one percent of synthetic fragrances. This product is also vegan, cruelty-free, and gluten-free.What Else You Need to Know: A viable alternative to hydroquinone, this pro-level treatment fights discoloration by removing over-pigmented surface cells, brightening skin tone, and fighting against environmental aggressors. Skin brightness improves in as early as two weeks, while diminishing visible discoloration in eight weeks. Why is my formula getting darker? Does that mean it’s no longer effective?The formula is expected to darken over time due to oxidation of the vitamin C. Oxidation is a natural process and does not necessarily correlate to degradation of vitamin C. Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare controls the conditions through formulation and packaging to ensure maximum shelf life. It is recommended to store the bottle in a cool, dark place.Clinical Results: In a double blind clinical study after 4 weeks:- 88% of subjects agreed that their dark spots and sun spots faded after using our serumAfter 2 weeks:- 80% of subjects agreed that their skin tone looks more even after using our serum",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,4.192660550458716,0.8165137614678899,1.1900596329610535,109,0.2648957010897841,0.2209469579536518,0.023572160720368447,0.26149403603560456,-0.15639287916112038,0.15589748339456413,https://www.sephora.com/product/clinical-grade-ipl-dark-spot-correcting-serum-P440308,-0.015943422318422305,11.0,15.0,30.0,1.8028303616251755,0.255441899027294,0.1080715726653936,-0.056728670634920625,4.0,9.0,16.0,58.0,0.1268049716161809,0.03901691434344028,-0.11166666666666664,1.0,3.0,4.0,22.0,0.045586062644636216,0.011396515661159054,0.1901010101010101,5.0,1.0,6.0,16.0,0.4364905634363539,0.3637421361969616,,,,,,,,-0.06614583333333332,1.0,2.0,4.0,13.0,0.06149031527616052,0.02049677175872017,-0.008692734147897188,30.0,36.0,69.0,1.6775351650736292,0.34023931259175594,0.1546542329962527,-0.036537771358543414,13.0,20.0,34.0,58.0,0.24682882231508205,0.09723559666957778,-0.002806299603174604,7.0,8.0,16.0,22.0,0.2480922525974644,0.1157763845454834,0.07128367003367002,6.0,3.0,9.0,16.0,0.35419734749908977,0.2361315649993932,,,,,,,,0.0045833333333333325,4.0,5.0,10.0,13.0,0.18877542947191397,0.08390019087640622,0.04306818181818182,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.240979989187638,0.30063605244263664,0.2254770393319775,0.0016666666666666705,1.0,1.0,2.0,58.0,0.09452865480086613,0.047264327400433064,0.125,1.0,0.0,1.0,22.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.04393939393939393,1.0,0.0,1.0,16.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,,,,,,,,,,,,13.0,,,0.19013685966810967,14.0,3.0,24.0,1.8995769689941744,0.5897007098262422,0.4856358786804347,0.1797548185941043,8.0,2.0,14.0,58.0,0.4901568467207234,0.3921254773765788,0.2,2.0,0.0,4.0,22.0,0.3423719528896193,0.3423719528896193,0.3266835016835017,3.0,0.0,3.0,16.0,0.4384939195509822,0.4384939195509822,,,,,,,,0.08888888888888889,1.0,1.0,3.0,13.0,0.09452865480086613,0.047264327400433064,0.02447700691121744,13.0,4.0,19.0,1.7303454881625968,0.5273775411082839,0.4032887079063348,0.10871464646464646,8.0,2.0,10.0,58.0,0.4901568467207234,0.3921254773765788,-0.06708333333333333,1.0,1.0,3.0,22.0,0.09452865480086613,0.047264327400433064,0.10416666666666664,3.0,0.0,3.0,16.0,0.4384939195509822,0.4384939195509822,,,,,,,,-0.2444444444444445,1.0,1.0,3.0,13.0,0.09452865480086613,0.047264327400433064,0.17332304526748973,4.0,0.0,6.0,1.3103282682215494,0.5100999795960008,0.5100999795960008,,,,,58.0,,,0.27955246913580245,2.0,0.0,2.0,22.0,0.3423719528896193,0.3423719528896193,0.21,1.0,0.0,1.0,16.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,,,,,,,,0.0902777777777778,1.0,0.0,3.0,13.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,109,352.0,86.0,,141.0,92.0

Skin Type: Normal, Dry, Combination, and Oily Skincare Concerns: Dullness and Uneven Texture, Fine Lines and Wrinkles, and Pores Formulation: Lightweight Liquid Highlighted Ingredients: - Lactic Acid (from Fermented Beet Sugar) and Glycolic Acid (Naturally Derived from Sugar Cane): Shed dead skin cells, exfoliate skin’s surface, and support natural cell turnover for a more even texture and radiant complexion. - Bromelain: A fruit enzyme derived from pineapple that digests the skin’s dead proteins (such as broken down collagen) and exfoliates, revealing younger-looking skin. - Centella Asiatica Extract (Gotu Kola or Tiger Grass): Widely used in traditional Asian medicine as well as in Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of skin diseases and for wound healing; has antioxidant properties and helps protect skin’s moisture barrier. Ingredient Callouts: Free of sulfates SLS and SLES, parabens, formaldehydes, formaldehyde-releasing agents, phthalates, mineral oil, retinyl palmitate, oxybenzone, coal tar, hydroquinone, triclosan, and triclocarban, and contains less than one percent of synthetic fragrances. This product is also vegan, cruelty-free, and gluten-free and comes in recyclable packaging. What Else You Need to Know: This two-step patented formula contains higher concentrations of peeling agents-glycolic acid, lactic acid, and bromelain-at 3.5 pH for powerful results. Customize your dosing strength with the included 100 percent organic, sterilized cotton balls for fast-acting, even peeling. Lactic acid hydrates by stimulating moisturization factors in skin to prevent trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). The outcome: visible signs of aging such as fine lines, wrinkles, and dark spots are reduced, and skin complexion is brighter and smoother-never stripped. Clinical Results: In a clinical study after just 2 weeks: - 100% of subjects showed improvement in skin radiance - 95% of subjects showed improvement in skin texture - 83% of subjects showed improvement in the appearance of pores",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,4.585585585585585,0.945945945945946,0.7442930565121201,111,0.08016286374109162,0.19808895299484405,0.11513398984708408,0.13579201582603606,-0.01949638235076021,0.16455459157223146,https://www.sephora.com/product/clinical-grade-resurfacing-liquid-peel-P442005,0.21436609686609687,10.0,1.0,13.0,1.8028303616251755,0.6226353745137962,0.5660321586489057,0.20074074074074072,7.0,1.0,9.0,58.0,0.5291051942301385,0.4629670449513712,0.11111111111111112,1.0,0.0,2.0,20.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.6000000000000001,1.0,0.0,1.0,13.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,,,,,1.0,,,0.15787037037037033,1.0,0.0,1.0,19.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.12039598170646562,17.0,7.0,31.0,1.6775351650736292,0.5083193634129031,0.3600595490841397,0.06391819985569985,7.0,5.0,14.0,58.0,0.3195073356553728,0.1863792791323008,0.14637301587301588,3.0,0.0,5.0,20.0,0.4384939195509822,0.4384939195509822,0.1892361111111111,4.0,1.0,8.0,13.0,0.3755282641185389,0.3004226112948311,,,,,1.0,,,0.1479166666666667,3.0,1.0,4.0,19.0,0.30063605244263664,0.2254770393319775,0.06378205128205129,6.0,1.0,13.0,1.240979989187638,0.4868654966809702,0.417313282869403,0.042638888888888886,3.0,1.0,6.0,58.0,0.30063605244263664,0.2254770393319775,,,,,20.0,,,0.09125,2.0,0.0,4.0,13.0,0.3423719528896193,0.3423719528896193,,,,,1.0,,,0.06944444444444445,1.0,0.0,3.0,19.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.14630306036556034,46.0,10.0,66.0,1.8995769689941744,0.7015856902425105,0.5763025312706336,0.11304450113378685,23.0,7.0,35.0,58.0,0.5907132766967573,0.4528801788008473,0.09085858585858587,6.0,1.0,11.0,20.0,0.4868654966809702,0.417313282869403,0.20381944444444444,5.0,2.0,8.0,13.0,0.3589290901482127,0.2563779215344376,0.6,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.20654329147389291,0.20654329147389291,0.22449494949494955,11.0,0.0,11.0,19.0,0.7411599827511859,0.7411599827511859,0.10549736987818384,25.0,7.0,43.0,1.7303454881625968,0.6124466920955516,0.4784739781996497,0.15484126984126986,14.0,2.0,21.0,58.0,0.6397666856325172,0.5597958499284525,-0.0009923469387755068,3.0,3.0,7.0,20.0,0.1876128068994087,0.09380640344970437,0.11357142857142855,4.0,0.0,7.0,13.0,0.5100999795960008,0.5100999795960008,,,,,1.0,,,0.06208333333333334,4.0,2.0,8.0,19.0,0.2999883213415286,0.1999922142276857,0.20793182451077188,15.0,2.0,19.0,1.3103282682215494,0.6566315750229009,0.579380801490795,0.2625757575757576,8.0,1.0,10.0,58.0,0.5649937852319398,0.5022166979839464,0.12572751322751324,3.0,0.0,4.0,20.0,0.4384939195509822,0.4384939195509822,2.7755575615628914e-17,1.0,1.0,2.0,13.0,0.09452865480086613,0.047264327400433064,,,,,1.0,,,0.2740123456790124,3.0,0.0,3.0,19.0,0.4384939195509822,0.4384939195509822,111,271.0,105.0,2.0,87.0,59.0

Skin Type: Normal, Dry, Combination, and Oily Skincare Concerns: Dryness, Redness, and Dullness and Uneven Texture Formulation: Rich Oil Highlighted Ingredients:- Fruit Salad Blend: A mix of non-fragrant soothing fruit extracts (blueberry, kiwi, and strawberry) and replenishing fruit oils (cranberry seed oil, açai fruit oil, and watermelon seed oil) that help comfort and moisturize skin. - Nourishing Oil Blend: A mix of moisturizing and lightweight oils such as marula seed, baobab seed, kalahari melon seed, mongongo, and ximenia that protect and nourish skin. - Bamboo Booster: Bamboo and charcoal powder gently exfoliate away built-up dead, dry skin. Ingredient Callouts: Free of essential oils, silicones, and fragrance, What Else You Need to Know: Formulated with clean, antioxidant-rich fruit extracts and oils to help soothe, plus a nourishing blend of African oils, Slaai™ transforms from oil to milk to cleanse and moisturize, leaving behind a dewy glow. Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of our formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, and always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels. This is the Drunk Elephant difference. Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.Awards: Refinary29, 2019 Editors Choice This Set Contains:- 3.88 oz/ 114.7 mL Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser - 0.10 oz/ 2.95 mL Bamboo Booster™ Clean at Sephora When you spot our Clean seal, you can be sure we’ve checked that this brand’s product is made without the ingredients you told us you’d most like to avoid.

Solutions for:- Uneven skin tone- Dullness and uneven texture- Dryness If you want to know more…This cult favorite brightening serum is powered by viniferine, a natural ingredient from grapevine sap that is 62 times more effective at brightening than vitamin C. Its lightweight satiny formula immediately absorbs into skin so it can get to work correcting dark spots such as acne scars, pigmentation, melasma, and sun spots. The serum also contains olive squalane, which is a non-greasy, hydrating ingredient that sinks quickly into skin to deliver moisturize. The serum works well under makeup for flawless-looking skin. For best results, use Vinoperfect Overnight Renewal Cream in the evening. Tip: apply under daily sunscreen for a more even tan. Vinoperfect Serum’s viniferine inhibits the production of tyrosinase, which in turn regulates the melanin leaving you with a smooth, more even tan.
