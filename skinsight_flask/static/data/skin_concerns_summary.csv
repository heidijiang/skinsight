What else you need to know: The JuJu Bar is vegan, fragrance- and soap-free, and formulated with skin-friendly ingredients designed to calm and feed the skin while promoting moisture retention. Unlike soap, which has a pH level of 9 or above, the Juju Bar’s ideal pH-level of 6.3 ensures sufficient cleansing without drying or stripping the skin of its protective barrier.Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of our formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, and always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels. This is the Drunk Elephant difference. Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.

Murad formulates with the highest level available without a prescription. In as little as one week, it fades the look of dark spots, sun spots, age spots, and uneven skin tone. Rapid Age Spot and Pigment Lightening Serum combines hydroquinone with hexapeptide-2, a powerful skin-brightening peptide that helps lighten dark spots and prevent the appearance of future damage for a more even, more radiant skin tone. Exfoliating glycolic acid lifts away dull, dead skin cells and allows active ingredients to penetrate more quickly, so you see spots fade faster and more radiant skin sooner.What it is formulated WITHOUT:- Parabens- Sulfates- PhthalatesWhat else you need to know: Hydroquinone is the only over-the-counter skin lightener approved by the FDA. For more than 50 years, dermatologists like Dr. Murad have prescribed hydroquinone because of its excellent ability to lighten frustrating dark spots, sun spots, and age spots on all skin tones. Even the most potent skin lightening treatments can be counteracted by UV light, a proven dark spot trigger. That’s why Dr. Murad’s skin lightening prescription always includes a daily SPF, such as City Skin Age Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 50 | PA++++.

Solutions for:- Oiliness- Makeup removal If you want to know more…With a unique blend of mild surfactants and makeup-dissolving emollients, this gentle formula rinses away without an ounce of residue, leaving skin clean and soft. What else you need to know:Beste™ No. 9 is formulated at an ideal, non-stripping pH level of 5.5. 100 percent free of essential oils, silicones, and fragrance. Note: In Afrikaans, Beste means Best. Even though the first eight versions weren’t exactly that, Drunk Elephant thinks they’ve finally found the best one yet. They are calling it Beste™ No. 9 after going through nine formulations to get there! Only the Beste will do. Note from Tiffany Masterson, Drunk Elephant Founder: ""We took your feedback about the original Beste and made some changes-we swapped out the twist top packaging for a trusty flip top and tweaked the formula so it’s gentle enough to use on eyes (and remove every last trace of makeup)."" Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of our formulations. They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what they call the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, and always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels. This is the Drunk Elephant difference.Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.Awards:- Oprah Magazine, September 2017 Beauty O-Ward- Self Magazine, 2018 Self Healthy Beauty Award- Cosmopolitan Magazine, 2018 Cosmopolitan Skin Award- Tatal Beauty, 2018 Editor's Pick Honorable Mention AwardClean at Sephora When you spot our Clean seal, you can be sure we’ve checked that this brand’s product is made without the ingredients you told us you’d most like to avoid.

It is cruelty-free, and formulated without gluten and animal-derived ingredients.There are many factors that contribute to a damaged skin barrier, including emotional stress, fatigue, dehydration, pollution, and over-exfoliation. When the barrier is damaged, skin experiences redness, dryness, and tightness. However, when the barrier is healthy, skin appears even-toned, clear, smooth, and balanced. ""‘Eat your water’ is a phrase I have been using for many years. Staying sufficiently hydrated isn’t just about drinking eight glasses of water a day. When we eat more water-rich foods, we absorb water more slowly because it is trapped in the nutritional structure of these foods. Slow absorption means that water in food stays in our bodies longer to optimize hydration. The same rule applies to skin. Applying nutrient-rich ingredients will strengthen the skin barrier and help our skin trap and hold onto more water, longer. That’s how the formula for Nutrient-Charged Water Gel was born.""-Howard Murad, M.D., FAAD Research results:Clinically tested by an independent laboratory and proven safe for sensitive skin.

They never take into account an ingredient’s synthetic or natural status, but instead choose based on its biocompatibility. You won’t find what Drunk Elephant calls the ""Suspicious 6"" in their products (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance/dyes, and SLS,) making them, in their opinion, appropriate for all skin. They believe that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue we see. When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety, always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels.

Solutions for: - Fine lines and wrinkles - Loss of firmness and elasticity - Dullness and uneven texture If you want to know more…This award-winning, bestselling serum replenishes the body’s own natural supply of EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor) and rejuvenates skin cells, thus helping to slow the aging process. From birth until adulthood, our bodies manufacture copious amounts of proteins called growth factors that communicate with cells, sending messages to repair, rejuvenate, and so on. EGF is one of the most important growth factor for skin cells, helping them to boost production of collagen and elastin and increase the skin’s capacity to retain water to maintain healthy, youthful and dense skin. When we reach maturity, production of growth factors diminishes. As a result, cell turnover and repair slows, eventually affecting our appearance. In fact, skin density thins by one percent each year after we turn twenty, and it is further reduced by up to 30 percent during menopause. Skin starts to sag and fine lines and wrinkles appear. There are many factors that play a role in skin aging and some are beyond our control, like genetics. We can, however, lead a healthy lifestyle, protect our skin from the sun, and use effective anti-aging skincare products. What else you need to know: This serum contains only seven ingredients; no preservatives or additives. The bottle may be small but the serum inside is incredibly potent and long-lasting. You only need two to four drops per nighttime use to see visible, lasting results. The barley-based EGF is uniquely pure and grown in an ecologically-engineered greenhouse in Iceland with a negative CO2 footprint.
